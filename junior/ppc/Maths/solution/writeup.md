# Maths writeup
Let's connect to the server. It sends us message describing tasks and 2 numbers. We are given 10 seconds to send multiplication of these numbers.

Instead of doing it by hands, we may write program using `socket` python library which will connect to the server and solve multiplications automatically. And, of course, in the end we mustn't forget about grabbing a flag. Checkout `solver.py` to see the example of solution.

Flag: **flag{7CP\_m47h\_w17h\_h3lp\_0f\_py7h0n}**
