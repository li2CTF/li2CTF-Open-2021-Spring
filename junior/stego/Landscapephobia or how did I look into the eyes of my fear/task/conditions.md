# Landscapephobia or how I compared 2 same images and lost my fear
You all had this feeling - when you look at image and feel discomfort with no reason for it. But, you are here not to think about it. Flag is in one of this images. go and take it, young python-boy!

P.S. Please don't forget about one rule from _flags-language_: Instead of 'O' we use '0'
