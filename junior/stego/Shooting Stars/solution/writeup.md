# Shooting Stars writeup
Let's look at changed lyrics. We can easily see that some letters are changed and some of them were changed to "{", "}" - parts of the flag. We can use online text comparator or create your own (checkout `solve.py`). After comparing we get array of chars which is a flag

Flag: **flag{n0_m0r3_c0un71ng_m4rk5_w1ll_b3_c0un71ng_fl4g5}**
