# Cryptography and k-pop
Shokersss loves to solve cryptography problems, but more than that, he likes to play piano covers of k-pop songs. Once again finding a new song that he liked, he decided to link cryptography and k-pop and eventually got this task. Try to find the flag.

Flag starts with `CTF...`, _all letters must be lowercase_ inside curly brackets. Hint: ㅋ - k, ㅌ - t)
