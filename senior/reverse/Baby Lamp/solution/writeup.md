# Baby Lamp writeup
Firstly, it's Lampanel Assembler - there are a lot of hints for it. It makes our life easier because we can run the code in `Lampanel` program.

After reading code, we understand that it simply encodes line. We store line itself and its size in `d`-mark. After understanding the algo, we write program to decode it (check `solver.py` to see an example) and take the flag.

Flag: **flag{l4mp5_4r3_50_c00l}**
